# Estate Pilot

This repository contains the Software Architecture Document for the system Estate Pilot, a real estate platform that allows users, brokers, and administrators to interact with property listings.  

The document describes:  

- The overall architecture and main modules (authentication, search, payments, scheduling, moderation, etc.).  
- How the system integrates with external services like Google Maps, payment providers, and banking APIs.  
- Deployment details, including servers, databases, and cloud scalability.  
- Quality attributes such as availability, security (GDPR compliance), and fraud protection.  

This file acts as the technical blueprint of Estate Pilot, guiding development, integration, and long-term maintenance of the system.
